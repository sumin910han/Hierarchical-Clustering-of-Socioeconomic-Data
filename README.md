Project Description

The main goal of this project is to process real-world socioeconomic data, implement hierarchical clustering, and visualize the clustering process. Each country is represented by a six-dimensional feature vector based on specific statistics, and hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) is performed to group countries with similar profiles.

Features

Each country is defined by the following six statistics:

  1. Population
  2. Net migration
  3. GDP ($ per capita)
  4. Literacy (%)
  5. Phones (per 1000)
  6. Infant mortality (per 1000 births)
